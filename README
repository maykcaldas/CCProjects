About identity and hate speech, I do believe people shouldn't be allowed to use sentences that would depreciate anybody. I do believe that "your right ends when mine starts". A well-defined line might exists and people should know what they can and what they can't say in order to now get the other people mood down. However, I believe that people who are being attacked (only in the specific situation of a non-physical attack) shouldn't get sad about being hated. Things are changing. But they are changing slowly. And we need to, somehow, survive untill the changes get done.

He use some manias like Beatles, sports and religion as examples. But he is focusing in the mania of learning English. He mention how is it going at China, India, Latin America and Southeast Asia.

Even I find the way things are going on China pretty weird, it's a good movement to learn English. Since almost every country has English speakers and internet is all develop in English, learning English make you able to participate to a huge amount of debates and conversations you wouldn't be able to if not speaking English. So, due to the need to be a global person nowadays, learning English is almost mandatory.

I'm living at São Gonçalo. It's pretty far from Ilha do Fundão. When I used the bus' system to arrive the campus, I spent 2 hours to get to the university. But nowadays, I go there by car. So it takes me just 40 minutes. I study at the Chemistry's Institute where I'm currently doing my PhD degree. The institute is on the sixth floor of the block A of the Technology Center. Often the elevators are broken down. So I need to go there by stairs. I love this university because despite the great opportunities and all the science it bring to me,  UFRJ makes me do exercises. It's a really complete university.
